My First Repository

I'm a beginner coder from the UK, completely new to it but loving it so far. I am working my way through How to Think Like a Computer Scientist and decided to dabble a tiny bit in HTML and see how I get on. I'm firstly here to set up a webpage, but I hope I'll find more fun stuff to do.
